Assignment 8


1. A brief summary of the AR model you built and why. Use whatever graphs you find helpful.
    The AR model I built has three shifts of the flow variable: 1 day, 2 day, and 5 day.I used the  first 500 flow entries (skipping the first 5 to account for the 5 day maximum shift) as training and then used all data after day 500 as the test dataset.  

2. An explanation of how you generated your forecasts and why (i.e. did you use your AR model or not?)


3. A brief summary of what you got out of the peer evaluation. How did you make your script better?


4. Describe the part of your script that you are most proud of and why.
