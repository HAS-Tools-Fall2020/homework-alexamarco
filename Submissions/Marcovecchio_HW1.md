Assignment 1

I downloaded the USGS data for the Verde River starting from 1989.  For this week,  I based the forecasts for each week of 2020 off the same week in 2019. I know that the weather patterns that impacted streamflow in 2019 may not be the same for this year, but I am hoping that they will at least be similar.

## Grade
3/3 - Great job!
