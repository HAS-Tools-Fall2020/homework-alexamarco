Assignment 2

This week's forecast was made by referencing the python script (week2_firstpython.py) provided by Dr. Condon.  First, I made a list on paper of the date ranges for each week of the semester.  Then, I manually adjusted the range displayed in the line plot 16 times in order to display each week of the semester individually.  I recognize that this is highly inefficient, but I am rusty with python and I did not want to break the code. I then estimated the average streamflow based on each week's line plot.
