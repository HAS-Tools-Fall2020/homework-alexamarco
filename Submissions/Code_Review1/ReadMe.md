Alexa Marcovecchio
Week 7 Homework

All you should have to do is open the Marcovecchio_HW7.py program and run it.  I have the code set up to access the streamflow_week7.txt file in my data folder. The program should print the forecasts from my regression model and the forecasts I actually want to submit to the competition.

## The Review:

1. Is the script easy to read and understand?
 - Are variables and functions named descriptively when useful?
 - Are the comments helpful?
 - Can you run the script on your own easily?
 - Are the doc-strings useful?

**Ans1**
 `I can understand the code well and it has great readability.  Your function, 'twoWeekForecasts' is really well defined and the notes given are really helpful.  For your autoregressive model, I can see that you shifted your days by 1, 2, and then 5 days using a training period the first 500 weeks.  Great Job!

2. Does the code follow PEP8 style consistently?
 - If not are there specific instances where the script diverges from this style?

**Ans2**
  `It does!  I do not find any PEP8 errors and the code is really well condensed.  It only given the outputs needed.  Clear and concise!

3. Is the code written succinctly and efficiently?
 - Are there superfluous code sections?
 - Is the use of functions appropriate?
 - Is the code written elegantly without decreasing readability?

**Ans3**
   `The use of functions is great.  There is a lot of detail given when describing what the function does and how is works from line '72' to '92'.  All code is written well and has great readability.  The efficiently of the code is what stands out to me the most.
